# constructor

Because Architecture should be for everyone.

Constructor has been designed around the idea of being able to provide clean sets of interfaces between components.

Of course, this could be done by using multiple projects, and manually specifying the dependencies between them.
Time consuming, complicated... and now, unnecessary.


Ivy is the default dependency resolver.


Usage:
construct.<extension> files define the build.
